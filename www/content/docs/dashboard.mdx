Valka includes a built-in web dashboard that is served directly by the Valka server. No additional setup is required — the dashboard is available as soon as the server starts.

## Accessing the Dashboard

Open your browser and navigate to the Valka server's HTTP address:

```
http://<your-server>:8989
```

The dashboard is a single-page application served alongside the REST API. There is no separate process or deployment step.

## Pages

- Active task counts by status
- Recent task throughput

### Tasks

Browse and filter all tasks:
- Filter by queue, status, and date range
- Search by task name or ID
- View task details inline

### Task Detail

Deep dive into a specific task:

- **Runs** — All execution attempts with worker info and duration
- **Logs** — Real-time structured log viewer per run
