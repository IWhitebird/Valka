title: Quick Start
description: Get Valka running in minutes with Docker Compose.
---

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and Docker Compose

## 1. Start Valka

Clone the repository and start the services with Docker Compose:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IWhitebird/Valka.git
cd Valka/deploy/docker
cp .env.example .env    # edit credentials if needed
docker compose up -d
```

This starts PostgreSQL and the Valka server. Migrations run automatically on first boot.

| Service | Port | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| REST API + Dashboard | `8989` | HTTP API and web UI |
| gRPC API | `50051` | Worker connections and client SDK |

## 2. Open the Dashboard

Visit [http://localhost:8989](http://localhost:8989) to access the web dashboard. You'll see real-time monitoring of tasks, workers, and events.

## 3. Create a Task

Use the REST API to create your first task:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8989/api/v1/tasks \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "task_name": "send-welcome-email",
    "queue_name": "emails",
    "input": {"to": "user@example.com", "subject": "Welcome!"}
  }'
```

The task will appear in the dashboard with status `PENDING`.

## 4. Write a Worker

Install the SDK for your language and connect a worker:

```typescript
import { ValkaWorker, type TaskContext } from "@valka/sdk";

const worker = ValkaWorker.builder()
  .name("email-worker")
  .serverAddr("localhost:50051")
  .queues(["emails"])
  .concurrency(4)
  .handler(async (ctx: TaskContext) => {
    const input = ctx.input<{ to: string; subject: string }>();
    ctx.log(`Sending email to ${input.to}...`);
    // your logic here
    return { status: "sent" };
  })
  .build();

await worker.run();
```

See the [SDK documentation](/docs/sdks/rust) for Rust, Python, and Go examples.

## 5. Monitor

Head back to the dashboard at [http://localhost:8989](http://localhost:8989) to watch tasks flow through the system in real time — from `PENDING` to `RUNNING` to `COMPLETED`.
